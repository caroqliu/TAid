      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Teaching Assistants are the unsung heroes of the computer science classroom, often working tirelessly with their students on bugs of endless kinds. If you've ever looked up from one student's computer only to find ten more raising their hands, then you know how chaotic a single help session can be. You're only human--how could you possibly know who's been waiting the longest for you to go to next? Enter TAid.</p>

      <h2>Our Teaching Model</h2>
      <p>Using a simple FIFO queue, TAid provides a list of students who have been waiting the longest for assistance. Members of the teaching staff can see which student to go to next and dismiss them once their question has been answered. Students can enter the queue by entering a five word (at maximum) summary of their question. This not only gives TAs the opportunity to see what kind of issue they are handling (say a logic error versus a compiling issue) but also forces students to reason through and identify their issues.</p>
